# RomCom

This is a book cover generator that allows you to pull in random information from a list to create covers, and you can even add your own.

## Motivation

This project was completed in a Turing Mod 1 project to practice and learn how to implement this type of code.

https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/romcom-pair.html

## Languages

Written in Javascript, CSS, and HTML

## Technology used

Build with Atom

Code stored on GitHub

Running on GitHub Pages

## How to use?

The site is live at https://hayleyw7.github.io/romcom/.

When the home view loads, one sees a book cover randomly generated from a list of images, titles, and descriptors. One can click the "Show New Random Cover" to be presented a different random cover.

One may click "Save Cover" to return to it later. To view saved covers again, one can click "View Saved Covers". To delete a saved cover, double click it.

One is also able to click "Make Your Own Cover" to create their own cover using any image, title, and tagline descriptors of their choosing. Fill out the form, and click "Make my book". Wherever the user is, they can always return home by clicking "Home".

## Future additions

Implement data validation and error handling into the form (disable the button until all fields are filled, provide error messages if data entered is not correct, etc)

Allow users to drag and drop saved posters into whatever order they want them to appear
